# Mash Up

Mash Up is a small Python package that can mix 2 songs in the most desirable way. It has been made by following **FULL-AUTOMATIC DJ MIXING SYSTEM WITH OPTIMAL TEMPO ADJUSTMENT BASED ON MEASUREMENT FUNCTION OF USER DISCOMFORT** Research Paper published at 10th International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference (ISMIR 2009).

For the demonstration purpose I have mashed [Fragmented](http://www.nihilus.net/soundtracks/Fragmented.mp3) and [Red E](http://www.nihilus.net/soundtracks/Red-e.mp3), each having tempo of 143 BPM and 123 BPM. Check out the **[Mashed Song](https://soundcloud.com/sayan-das-869256052/mash-up)**. Fade in starts at 5min 19seconds.

## DJ Mixing Technique

### Optimal Tempo Adjustment Coefficient Computation (OTAC)

In order to automatically generate a smooth Song to Song (StS) transition, a unique tempo adjustment technique is applied. It computes the optimal tempo adjustment coeffecients, here after described as OTAC, which express the factors of tempo adjustment for the songs to be consecutively played, thus it is capable of automatically generating smooth StS transition for any given combination of song. Diagram below shows the tempi of the target songs in StS transition. Here `Ta` & `Tb` are the tempo of song A & B.

### Beat Adjustment and Crossfading

Here the two songs cross fades with each other. When songs with strong beats is adjusted to weaker beat of the other song, this cause discomfortness to hear.
So to eliminate the above problem it computes the `cross-correlation of the beats of the target songs withn the range of the cross fade`. The power located near the beats are passed as the parameters. The power of spectograme are computed by the `Fast Fourier Transformation` of the song sampled at `22,500Hz`.

## Song Selection

>This part is under construction!!
 
It will use aural similarity to determine the mashability of two song. Songs which have the highest similarity will be chosen.

For this it samples the audio at 22,500Hz converting it into raw power signal. Then Step Wise Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) can be used to bin the power into 12 semi tones. Thus for each song we get 12*(number of sample points) matrix, called chroma.

It will then compute the cosine distance between corresponding chroma vectors of the two songs to come up with an array of cosine distance. From their mean can be calculated. A smaller cosine distance means the songs have close semitone composition and thus well sound well together.
